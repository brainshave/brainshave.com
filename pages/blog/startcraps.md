# Startcraps

Published: London, 2014-10-22; written: Paris, 2014-09-16.

TLDR: If you work for a startup that is crap, an actual *startcrap*,
just quit it, hopefully it will soon die. (Because your colleagues
will follow.)

We are wasting our time on useless companies based on worthless
ideas. We are the worst and the most spoilt generation I know. We are
in such demand that nobody is challenging us anymore.

We are smart people but it is a waste because for our own
self-indulgence we create picture-sharing social networks for cats and
pugs, hedgehogs and red pandas; instead of solving real-world, hard
problems, aka problems people actually *have*.

Our mission is to build *automats* (hardware, software or processes run by
humans), entities relieving people from repetitive labour. With tools
given to us and the ones we are capable of creating, we can solve
problems once-for-all at a scale not possible before but we are
wasting this opportunity.

Our mission is *not* to make people even more distracted with another
feed-me habit-provoking, self-important app, which only causes the
opposite effect: in fact, we are creating more repetitive labour for
people by making them check yet another stream of updates. App for
app's sake.

What stops us? We, in our middle class white society, again, are
spoilt. We had to fight for nothing really. Previous generations gave
us multitude of freedoms and securities that we now take for granted:
peace, free speech, democracy, clean water, internet, free (as in
taxes) healthcare (apart of dear Americans, you're screwed here, I
sympathise) or free (as in taxes) education (again, Americans, I
sympathise).

Consequence of our wealth is that real problems are hard to
spot. During our first twenty years of life we learn to be content
with what we have and everything outside of it is a blind spot. To
find useful projects to work on we need to get out of our comfy zone
and look for problems other people are having, instead of inventing
what is essentially throw-away toys.

If we don't care for other people's problems while not having a
worthwhile ones of our own, why do we want to be problem solvers in
first place? We might as well just quit and serve burgers.

So how can we, programmers, designers, UX specialists, data
scientists, administrators, business people and marketing executives
make a point here? Simple: refuse to work for companies doing
worthless crap.

## Disrupting as in "getting in my way"

Not saying that what follows are disqualifying factors but one should
get a hint if they see some of these in their company:

- it "disrupts" (rather than a market, just daily lives of users who were absolutely happy without it)
- it is targeted to people who already have everything they need
- self-importance, "app for app's sake"
- "social network for…"
- platform exclusivity
- accessibility "planned in near future"
- "move fast and break things" plastered all over the place
- employees "encouraged" to work overtime
- the CEO openly admits they will just sell in two years and they "have already rejected offers"
- there is a picture of a cat somewhere on the marketing page

Some real world problems are boring, some are local, some are global,
some can use the hardware we already have, some need new hardware to
be invented. Some will never need an iOS app. Some actually do not
require any app at all.

## Lens

We look at the problems the wrong way. We are highly skilled in, for
example, writing iOS apps. It is our Pavlov reaction that when we see
a problem, we want to solve it with an iOS app, forgetting that a
world outside iOS ecosystem exists or assuming that "in our use case"
iOS ecosystem is large enough to cover enough population so we don't
feel guilty.

We look at a problem and try to forcefully apply the tools we already
know while it should be the other way around: we start from zero and
then find or *invent* the tools that will provide us with a path to
solve a given problem.

Looking at a problem from perspective of tools limits our vision: our
lenses are fixed at a near distance and everything else is just a
blurry pulp of bokeh.

We limit ourselves to only apply computers and networks. There are
issues out there waiting to be solved that would involve also
logistics, politics, "blood and sweat" physical labour, geology,
medicine or *x*.

We are just so very much reluctant to work across disciplines, instead
we prefer to invent problems no one ever had just to stay within our
comfy geeky zone. This is a big red signal that we apparently run out
of any worthwhile problems where only computers apply.

## The Brohood

It is impressive to show off big numbers to improve your masculinity
score among The Brohood. The constant struggle to maximise certain
metrics (like … and …) is nothing more, nothing less than comparing
penises at urinals and it is just as disgusting.

Shooting for The Brohood's acclaim is only another factor limiting our
creative ideas. Projects that will not impress the The Brohood are
less likely to be pursued because of the fear of being left outside of
The Brohood: fear of not being sexy enough. Pursuing sexiness in a
startup is a wanking competition, a sick and blinding game.

Today's problems are more social than social networks. Think local
issues of normal people in your neighbourhood. Think local issues of
people in a city nearby, or in a different country. The unsexy issues
of unsexy people. It is those other, ugly people, not *us*, right?

## We are investors too

What we give as employees is our personal investment in a company. We
give the companies we work for our passion and time: two important
resources that if we invest badly we will become burn out (passion) or
dead (time) before doing anything of significance.

We invest in useless companies, being attracted with impressive
salaries and unmatched perks. At the same time our CEO thinks only how
to sell the company for good monies: "good riddance!" and start
over. (*Your* CEO is an exception so don't worry!)

## This *is* a call to quit your job

Being investors, just like those giving money and "moral support", we
have real impact on which company lives and which dies, basically by
cutting off our investment, aka our employment there.

Reassess the value of your company. If it doesn't cut it to *your*
standards *now*, quit. Just do it, stop believing that "maybe it is
not so good now but in a year…"

If this way you will effectively kill this company, don't feel sorry
for your CEO, they will have another startup in no time and quickly
forget about this one. They might even thank you in retrospect because
the new one will be *so* much better.

Founders, CEOs and startups are recyclable commodities.

## Summary

For founders and CEOs:

- Look outside of your own (oft-imagined) problems.
- It's not just apps.
- Don't shoot for "sexy".
- Don't waste people's time by hooking them to your product just for the product's own sake.

For employees:

- Quit the job you hate, *now*.
